# Dependency Injection Lifetimes in .NET

## Overview

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in .NET for achieving Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. DI allows us to manage object lifetimes efficiently and promote loose coupling between components.

In .NET, DI provides three primary service lifetimes:

1. **Transient**
2. **Scoped**
3. **Singleton**

Each lifetime serves a different purpose, and it's important to choose the right one based on the requirements of your application.

## 1. Transient

- **Definition**: Services registered with a `Transient` lifetime are created each time they are requested. A new instance is provided to every controller and service.
- **Use Case**: Use `Transient` services for lightweight, stateless services. Since they are created every time they are requested, they can be useful when the service is not resource-intensive.
- **Example**:
  ```csharp
  services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
  ```

## 2. Scoped

- **Definition**: Services registered with a `Scoped` lifetime are created once per request. Within a single request, the same instance is used across all controllers, services, and other components.
- **Use Case**: Use `Scoped` services when you want to maintain state within a single request. This is useful for scenarios where you need to share data between different parts of the application during a request.
- **Example**:
  ```csharp
  services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();
  ```

## 3. Singleton

- **Definition**: Services registered with a `Singleton` lifetime are created once and shared across the entire application. The same instance is used for all requests and all users.
- **Use Case**: Use `Singleton` services for stateful services or heavy objects that are costly to create and can be shared across the application. Be cautious with `Singleton` services as they can lead to potential issues with shared state across different users.
- **Example**:
  ```csharp
  services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();
  ```

## Choosing the Right Lifetime

When choosing a lifetime, consider the following:

- **Transient**: For stateless and lightweight services.
- **Scoped**: For services that should maintain state within a single request.
- **Singleton**: For services that should be shared across the application and are expensive to create.
